      "\n",
      "Add a `.gitattributes` file to your project and use standard git-style path matchers for the files you want to override to set `linguist-documentation`, `linguist-language`, and `linguist-vendored`. `.gitattributes` will be used to determine language statistics, but will not be used to syntax highlight files. To manually set syntax highlighting, use [Vim or Emacs modelines](#using-emacs-or-vim-modelines).\n",

      "Checking code you didn't write, such as JavaScript libraries, into your git repo is a common practice, but this often inflates your project's language stats and may even cause your project to be labeled as another language. By default, Linguist treats all of the paths defined in [lib/linguist/vendor.yml](https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/lib/linguist/vendor.yml) as vendored and therefore doesn't include them in the language statistics for a repository.\n",

      "#### Generated file detection\n",
      "\n",
      "Not all plain text files are true source files. Generated files like minified js and compiled CoffeeScript can be detected and excluded from language stats. As an added bonus, unlike vendored and documentation files, these files are suppressed in diffs.\n",

      "\n",
